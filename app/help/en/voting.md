# Voting

> Voting is important in Seer in the same way it is important to the community in which you live. The weight of your vote is directly correlated to the number of SEER you own. If you aren't heavily involved in the community, you are encouraged to choose a proxy who represents your interests. If you would like to be more involved in the community, check out these [channels](/help/introduction/bitshares).

## Proxy

> You may choose to **not** be active in the governance of Seer. If this is the case, it's important that you choose someone in the Seer community who you identify with and set that entity as your proxy. This gives them to the power to vote on your behalf with your SEER shares backing their vote. This is similar to electing a representative.

## Committee

> The committee is a set of entities that are approved by the shareholders and set policy for the Seer blockchain including:

* Transaction and trading fees
* Blockchain parameters, such as block size, block interval
* Referral and vesting parameters such as cash back percentage and vesting periods
